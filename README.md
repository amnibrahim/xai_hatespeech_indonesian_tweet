# Detection of Hate Speech on Indonesian Twitter: An Explanation

## About the .ipynb
We studied hate speech detection in Indonesian Twitter in this research and attempted to explain it. A dataset from a prior study was used, which included 13169 tweets labeled as hate speech or non-hate speech. Several traditional machine learning models were trained to determine whether a tweet classified as hate speech or not, with the models achieving a high level of accuracy overall. However, after examining the models' predictions explanations, we discovered that only XGBoost provided the most logical LIME explanations for the predictions produced. As a result, model interpretability techniques such as LIME can assist in the selection of the optimal model among several that yield great results. This model interpretability technique could also be used to give end users with reasoning for a model's prediction.
